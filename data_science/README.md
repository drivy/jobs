# Getaround EU Data scientist Challenge

Looking for a job? Check out our [open positions](https://www.welcometothejungle.com/en/companies/getaround/jobs).
You can also take a look at our [product blog](https://medium.com/getaround-eu) and [engineering blog](https://getaround.tech/index.html) to learn more about the way we work.

## General Guidelines

- Clone this repo (do **not** fork it)
- Download the datasets using the link sent by your interviewer.
- When you are done with this challenge, create a private repository and submit it to your interviewer who should have provided you with their GitHub username. Let them know by email!

## Challenge specifications

**The goal is to build a proof of concept (POC) for a new ranking algorithm for Getaround's search engine.**

*Usual time to complete this test: 3 - 5 hours*

- Your answers should include working code/notebook and a presentation to showcase your work.
- Your code should be written in Python.
- Your code should be reproducible.
   - include the versions of the libraries used 
   - locate the datasets given in the `/data` subdirectory (it won't be committed as it is already added to the .gitignore).
- Keep in mind that we value enhancing business goals with pragmatic and easy-to-maintain code over raw model performance.

### 1 - Exploratory analysis
*We recommend to take 20% of your case-study time on this part*
 - Explain what is the current behaviour of users with the current ranking algorithm.
 - Share what you believe to be the main challenges for this ranking task.
 - Share the business and product insights that you find the most useful to share to non-data colleagues.

### 2 - Create a proof-of-concept ranking model
*We recommend to take 60% of your case-study time on this part*

Create a proof of concept algorithm which :
 - takes as input a request and a list of cars matching the request criteria
 - renders an index to rank this list of cars based on their chances to be booked

You'll need to add to your presentation : 
 - an overview of your model and your approach
 - explain the relevant feature engineering or optimization work you have done
 - describe next steps for further improvements of model performance

### 3 - From POC to production
*We recommend to take 20% of your case-study time on this part*

Describe the next steps needed to bring your POC to a production-ready model and how you will keep it running smoothly.

## Data and context

### How does the search engine work?
 - Users input an address of search and desired dates and time for their trip. 
    - Optionally, users can filter the results on various criteria such as the type of car (city, sedan, commercial vans..), price, options (AC, snow tires..) etc..
 - The search engine renders a list of cars. It follows 2 main steps to do so:
    - Filtering: Generate the list of cars that matches the search request: ie. Cars nearby the address, that are available for the dates of search, and that match the selected filters. This is already done for you and not in the scope of this project.
    - Ranking: Order the list based on a score. Current score is computed with a simple heuristic. This test is focused on this ranking part.

 - Anytime the user changes a parameter, filter or page number, a new request is sent to the search engine and the results refresh.
 - Users can then visit different car listings, select cars and eventually book one of them.

## Available data
*Note 1 : These data are not representative of Getaround's real data*

*Note 2 : More data than needed is given, but is kept if you want to dig on the system's behaviour*

 - **Search Requests**: a search request is a set of parameters and filters values sent to the search engine. These data have been enriched with some user historical data at the time of the request.
 - **Impressions**: list of the 20 first cars rendered by the existing algorithm for each search request, with their relative data (car characteristics, position in the search etc..) and conversion information (visit, selection, booking)

To simplify the scope of this case-study, search requests and impressions are filtered only on the first page that is shown to the user (top 20 cars)

### Search-requests detailed documentation

One row = One request sent to the search engine, with information on search parameters, filters selected and historical user stats.
